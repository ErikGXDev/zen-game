# This is a mini golf game

Very WIP

# Planned

**Singleplayer**

- Singleplayer Campaign
- Level (Golf Course) Editor with
  Custom Level Format (base53 compression or binary files (although that wouldnt be very browser friendly))

**Design**

- different color palettes that the user can choose
- a more vibrant color palette (current one is too dark)

**Multiplayer**

- Highscores
- Sharing Levels
- Multiplayer through peer-to-peer (PeerJS, would still need a server though which is a problem)
